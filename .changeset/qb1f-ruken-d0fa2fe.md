Bundle Ruken's packages from RukenApp `d0fa2fe` instead of `b30d31b` (`VENDORED.md` names the commit and hashes). The bundled `@ruken/sdk-host` and `@ruken/cli` now declare `zod` 4.6.6 (the SDK only as a dev dependency; `@ruken/manifest` does not use zod), so nothing in AF installs 4.6.5 (GHSA-mrhx-c7xc-m3w5). The SDK also trusts Ruken's private beta sites as hosts, and Ruken's host now answers `Hosting.leaderboards.get` with the player's own entry only; the call is unchanged.
